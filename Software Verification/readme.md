This C code is created to test whether the reason of SDK code not working properly was caused by a mistake during HLS to C conversion or it was purely due to lack of memory or 
unefficient usage of memory problem. All header files are merged into a single C file which is main.c. It is observed that conversion into C is successful since we could see
the output. This made us sure that the problem is due to either lack of memory or unefficient usage of memory by us.
