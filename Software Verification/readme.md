This C code is created to test whether the reason of SDK code not working properly was caused by a mistake during HLS to C conversion or it was purely due to lack of memory or unefficient usage of memory problem. All the header files except for the pgconv file that has the C version of the compute_engine_64 function, which you can find in Vivado SDK Files folder, are merged into a single C file as a pure software design which is "main.c". It is observed that conversion into C is successful since we could see the output. This made us sure that the problem is due to either lack of memory or unefficient usage of memory by us.
We used DevC++ version 5.11 to run this code. You can run it by creating a new project and copying the C code provided in "main.c" and pasting into the newly created project.
Finally you should click on "Compile and Run" to get the results in a command window. These results are used for the inference process.
